Hello World
 
<h1> Homework 1 </h1> 

<p> The section that stood out to me the most was the first one "The cat ate my source code". This section was something that I relate to because I am someone that embraces failure and my own shortcomings. I think that this is very important for anyone in any field to accept. Once you are okay with things going wrong it allows you to push boundaries and work freely without constantly being in fear. This section really explains the importance of accepting failure and I feel that it was really well written </p>

<p> Another thing that I really liked about this section was that it was about analyzing a situation for things that are beyond your control. Before taking on a project, it is important to see what things you are not able to do, so that you have realistic expectations. It also offers some helpful tips on how to deal with mistakes and be accountable for them. One of my favorite parts was that it talked about how to fix mistakes and have a backup plan. A  backup plan can really make a huge difference when you do make a mistake. Even if you are not able to do what was expected you can somehow makeup for it if you think ahead.</p>

<p> I also really liked that they talked about running through conversations in your mmind and thinking about how a conversation would go. For example if you were going to ask your professor a question, you should think about what could possibly be the answer before asking the question. There have been many times that I asked a proffesor a question that I would have known if I had simply thought a little harder. As simple as it may seem, thinking a little harder or in a different way can really make a difference.</p>
